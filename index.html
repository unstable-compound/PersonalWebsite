            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Curtis Lewis, I am a software engineer with an interest
              in a wide range of developer roles. I have a particular focus on
              machine learning, but I am happy in almost any capacity where I am
              tasked with solving problems. I am currently a student at Portland
              State University, where I am expected to graduate this Spring
              (2020).
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time I enjoy gardening, especially growing fresh
              produce to cook with. I also spend a lot of my free time trying to
              learn new things, sometimes for my chosen profession to keep
              myself sharp, and sometimes in an effort to learn outside of my
              field and broaden my understanding of the world around me.

              <p>
                For this site, I have curated my long list of jobs I've had to
                provide details only on those that show relevance to my
                professional and academic goals. However, I have been working
                since I was 15, full-time since I was 18, and the collective
                experience of fighting uphill to support myself and pursue
                higher education has given me more perspective and a wider range
                of soft skills than this list might shine a light on.
