          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Curtis Lewis, I am a software engineer with an interest
            in a wide range of developer roles. I have a particular focus on
            machine learning, but I am happy in almost any capacity where I am
            tasked with solving problems. I am currently a student at Portland
            State University, where I am expected to graduate this Spring
            (2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I enjoy gardening, especially growing fresh produce
            to cook with. I also spend a lot of my free time trying to learn new
            things, sometimes for my chosen profession to keep myself sharp, and
            sometimes in an effort to learn outside of my field and broaden my
            understanding of the world around me.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
              For this site, I have curated my long list of jobs I've had to
              provide details only on those that show relevance to my
              professional and academic goals. However, I have been working
              since I was 15, full-time since I was 18, and the collective
              experience of fighting uphill to support myself and pursue higher
              education has given me more perspective and a wider range of soft
              skills than this list might shine a light on.

                This is my current job. In this capacity I help undergraduates

              <p>
                At HP Inc. I developed an end to end solution for the MSB R&D
                team to use for memory management on their ULE LaserJet
                products. The feature I developed simplified the process of
                managing tables in memory and reduced the codesize of the ULE
                product's firmware, which operates in a very constrained
                memory-environment. In addition, the feature enabled a vital
                security process to run on the ULE products.
